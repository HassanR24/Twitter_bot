The goal of the Bot was to check the current internet speed and then compare it to the promised/contract
internet speed by the provider. If the speed was below the promised/contract speed, the bot is supposed 
to save the current download and upload speed in a variable, login to Twitter account, start writing a new 
tweet mentioning the internet provider and speed we are getting comparing it to the speed we were supposed to 
get and tweeting it.
I created the whole script with Selenium to automate the whole process. From opening speed 
test site, grabbing the required data, opening and logging into the twitter account, writing the tweet 
mentioning the internet provider and tweeting it.
